Nebulous Adventure Documentation
================================

Included in this documentation is all of the required materials to satisfy the
grading of the project.

The Professor has been teaching the [Unified Process][UP] and these are the
materials needed for it.

## The Unified Process (UP)

The UP can be broken down as follows:
* **Inception Phase:** Which is the smallest and earliest phase in the project. It is
  meant for creating the actual idea for the project and identifiying things
  that can go wrong/right, project schedule, cost estimate, etc.

* **Elaboration Phase:** This is where the project is fleshed out in its design
  entirety. Things that go with this phase are listed below:
    * List of nouns
    * List of conceptual classes
    * Domain Model
    * List of Use Cases

* **Construction/Iteration Phase:** This is where the project is created. It
  involves taking what was done in the previous phases and making it all work.
  This phase is broken up into individual pieces called *iterations*. These
  iterations focus on key things concerning the project to ensure it will be
  completed on time.
